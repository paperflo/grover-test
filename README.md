# How to run

*Step 1*: Clone this repo locally if you haven't already
          (`git clone git@github.com/paperflo/grover-test.git`).

> All the following commands should be run in this project's root directory.

*Step 2*: Run `bundle install` and `npm install`.

*Step 3*: Run `ruby main.rb <FILE>` where `FILE` is the path to a file
          containing the HTML to be converted.

**Done!** You should now have a `grover-result.pdf` file
          in this project's directory.
          See the result with something like `open grover-result.pdf`.
